# PingDirectory Go Client

This repository contains a Go client for interacting with the PingDirectory configuration API. It is generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.

For a client tied to a specific version, add a version qualifier matching the PingDirectory version to your `require` in `go.mod`.

For example, for a client for PingDirectory 9.1.0.0:
```
require github.com/pingidentity/pingdirectory-go-client/v9100 v9100.6.0
```

The `.6.0` refers to the version of this client module.

For detailed documentation, see the `README` and `docs/` folder in the `configurationapi/` folder.

## Example - Creating a Location config object

```
...

import client "github.com/pingidentity/pingdirectory-go-client/v9100/configurationapi"

...

addRequest := client.NewAddLocationRequest("MyLocation")
basicAuthContext := context.WithValue(ctx, client.ContextBasicAuth, client.BasicAuth{
	UserName: username,
	Password: password,
}
apiAddRequest := r.apiClient.LocationApi.AddLocation(basicAuthContext)
apiAddRequest = apiAddRequest.AddLocationRequest(*addRequest)
addResponse, httpResp, err := r.apiClient.LocationApi.AddLocationExecute(apiAddRequest)
```
