      description: Specifies how the server should handle error log messages (which may include errors, warnings, and notices) generated during startup. All of these messages will be written to all configured error loggers, but they may also be written to other locations (like standard output, standard error, or the server.out log file) so that they are displayed on the console when the server is starting.

Enabling support for insecure TLS protocols is discouraged, and is generally recommended only as a short-term measure to permit legacy clients to interact with the server until they can be updated to support more secure communication protocols.
