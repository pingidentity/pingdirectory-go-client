Any connection associated with this Client Connection Policy which has been idle for longer than this length of time may be terminated.

          type: integer
          description: >-

          description: >-
              Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be in progress for any connection. This can help prevent a single client connection from monopolizing server processing resources by sending a large number of concurrent asynchronous requests. A value of zero indicates that no limit will be placed on the number of concurrent requests for a single client.
        maximumConcurrentOperationWaitTimeBeforeRejecting:

              Specifies the maximum length of time that the server should wait for an outstanding operation to complete before rejecting a new request received when the maximum number of outstanding operations are already in progress on that connection. If an existing outstanding operation on the connection completes before this time, then the operation will be processed. Otherwise, the operation will be rejected with a "busy" result.
